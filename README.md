Quantum Aether Dynamics simulations

### Code for QAD Particle paper: "Spontaneous Emergence of the Standard-Model Particle Spectrum from Classical Electrodynamics on a Discrete Lattice" <br>

Full code that produced the results in the paper: <br>
[FULL BRAID SIMUATION](qad_braid_simulation.py)

There is also a simpllified version for easier compute: <br>
[SIMPLIFIED BRAID SIMUATION](qad_braid_simple.py)

For revised Paper 2 we compare a cubic lattice to a hex lattice, this is the code used in the paper for a Hex lattics: <br?
